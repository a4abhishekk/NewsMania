# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Error 426 from newsapi.org occurred because, newsapi.org api in developer plan is no more working in production. because in developer plan CORS is only enabled for localhost.

Developer Plan $0 CORS enabled for localhost. https://newsapi.org/pricing

but if you want to fetch news in production then there is a alternative for this which have 1000 request per month free works in production also . https://newsapi.in/

Newsapi.in this website provide api that have cors enabled for all origins.

Enjoy...
